Disclaimer: I didn't draw these backgrounds. They are public domain photos that I edited.
You're welcome to use mine, but I recommend making your own to give your game a unique look!
Here's how to do it:

1. Find a site where you can download public domain images (like https://pxhere.com/ or https://www.goodfreephotos.com/).
2. Search for something like "dark forest" or "forest horizon".
3. Find an image you like, download.
4. Open up in an image editor (i.e. Photoshop, Aseprite, etc).
5. Crop to an area that looks good as a background.
6. Resample to 512x512 pixels.
7. Reduce the color count to something like 8 or 16 colors (indexed color mode).
8. Adjust color settings (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc), until you get something you like.
9. A background should generally have less contrast and saturation than the foreground, the brightness level will change the mood or time of day.
10. Try different backgrounds until it looks just right!
