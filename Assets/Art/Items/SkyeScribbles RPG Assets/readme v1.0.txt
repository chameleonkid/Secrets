Hi! Thank you for purchasing the SkyeScribbles's 16x16 Fantasy RPG Items pack.

The two folders contain two different versions of the assets, one with a dark outline for a cartoonier game, and the other without dark outlines for something more serious. One may display better on your interfaces and world too, so keep that in mind while choosing one =)

There is an image included in both folders that is simply all the assets on one spritesheet put together programmatically. 

The folders sort all the items into smaller categories as well. These folders contain separate 16x16 images for each and every item. There are also smaller spritesheet images which just contain everything in that folder.

If you have any questions or find any issues, email me at skyescribbles.art@gmail.com

Feel free to send me pictures of what you use my stuff for, too! I'm looking forward to seeing it all.
