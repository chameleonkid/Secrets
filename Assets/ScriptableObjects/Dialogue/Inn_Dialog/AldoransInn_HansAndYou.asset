        He said that you might be able to help me with a task.'

      text: (sighs heavily) Yes, my troops went missing during a recent mission in
        the forest. We've been searching for them for days now, but we haven't had
        any luck. I can't spare any more men for this mission, so I need someone
        else to do it.

      text: I see. Well, I'm willing to help. What do you need me to do?
    - _speakerIndex: 0
      text: You need to go into the forest and find any sign of my troops. Look for
        their camp, their weapons, anything that can tell us what happened to them.
        And be careful, the forest is full of dangerous creatures and bandits.

      text: Understood. And what should I do once I find something?
    - _speakerIndex: 0
      text: Come back here and report to me. I'll decide what to do next based on
        your findings. And if you bring back any of my men alive, I'll make sure
        you're rewarded.
