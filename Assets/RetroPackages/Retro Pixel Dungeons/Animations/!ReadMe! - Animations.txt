Some of the objects in Retro Pixel Dungeons are animated. You'll notice that some are already set up to animate, like the Torch and Brazier.

For the other objects, all animations have been set up and Animator trees are ready to be configured for use in your game. For instance, the wood and metal chests both have open and close animations in their animator trees. You can use these Animators as templates to set the objects up for use in your game!

Happy developing!
